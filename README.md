# Module5
This assignment was about financial planning. In this scenario the client had shares in SP500 (SPY) and aggregate bonds (AGG). The code enabled me to not only see how much the stocks were worth, but also was able to get a rough estimate of how much much they'd be worth in the future, using a Monte Carlo simulation. Some of the technologies I used included API keys, Timestamps, plotting, dataframes, and more. At one point I was even able to convert cryptocurrency to dollars to see if the client had enough for an emergency fund. And thanks to the Monte Carlo simulation, I was able to view the client's stock prices 5, 10, and 30 years into the future to help plan better when the client could retire.
